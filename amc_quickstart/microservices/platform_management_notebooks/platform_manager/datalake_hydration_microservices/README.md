# Workflow Management Service

The Workflow Management Service is an Amazon Ad Tech solution that adds functionality for managing Amazon Marketing Cloud workflows.

**Purpose**

- The Purpose of the Workflow Management Service is to allow AMC users to automate the creation, scheduling, and execution of AMC workflows without having to develop a custom solution. Below is a list of the features of the service.

**Integrates with the Tenant Provisioning Service**

- Adding or updating a customer record to the Tenant Provisioning Service will trigger automated deployment of the SQS queues, IAM policies, workflows and workflow schedules in WFM for the customer's AMC instance.

**Integrates with the Workflow Library Service**

- The Workflow Management Service can synchronize workflows and workflow schedules in the Workflow Library service with multiple AMC Instances.

**Creates a buffer between API Execution Requests and the AMC API**

- Within WFM, Execution requests are sent to an SQS queue rather than directly to the AMC endpoint. It prevents timeout failures when there are large number of requests executed in a short period of time.

**Enables dynamic time windows for executions**

- AMC's scheduling feature only allows predefined scheduled reporting such as Daily or Weekly. WFM Allows workflows to be scheduled with dynamic relative time windows.

**Tracks AMC Workflow executions**

- WFM tracks the status of all workflow executions for customer AMC instances whether they are submitted through WFM or other means (postman, etc.). Having the status synced to DynamoDB allows events to be triggered or notifications to be sent when executions change state. This table can also be used to track historical executions for troubleshooting or performance monitoring.

## Prerequisites

1. The WFM Stack resources are deployed as part of the AMC Quickstart package. Refer to the AMC QuickStart Deployment Steps in order to deploy the TPS Stack.
2. AWS Account
3. IDE for e.g. [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)
4. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

## AWS Service Requirements

The following AWS services are required for this utility:

1. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
2. [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
3. [Amazon Cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
4. [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
5. [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)
6. [Amazon Simple Queue Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)
7. [Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/)
8. [AWS Key Management Service (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)

## Resources Deployed

This CDK Application deploys the following resources:

1. Deploys the cdk stack `workflow_management_services.py` present in the repository. This stack will be deployed in the microservices pipeline stage of the CICD Pipeline defined in the `app.py`.

### Parameters

Before deploying the pipeline, ensure that the `wfm_parameters` dictionary in the `ddk.json` file contains the correct following parameters for the **WFM** stack:

1. `team` — The name of the team which owns the pipeline.
2. `pipeline` — Name to give the pipeline being deployed.
3. `dataset` - Name of the dataset being deployed.

The `ddk.json` is the same level as `app.py` within `amc-quickstart`. If the parameters are not filled, default values for team, pipeline, and dataset will be used (i.e. demoteam, dlhs and amcdataset).

### Deployment

Refer to the AMC QuickStart Deployment Steps in order to deploy this stack.
